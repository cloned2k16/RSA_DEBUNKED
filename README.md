what if,,  
the ( usual ) ASSUMPTION on which is based the famous ''security'' algorithm you rely on ..  
IS ACTUALLY FLAWED at the very root Â¿?

![images tells more than thowsand words ..](logo.jpg)

### what's the point ?
Well,  
suppose I can predict exactly where and how any prime will show up ?  
In fact this wouldn't sound strange at all, question is ..  
why still anybody BELIEVE  that,
prime numbers, are apearing randomply sparse directly from the hand of some GOD ?  
they are just predictable as many others things, which despite having,  
a coahotic progression, that prevents them from being predictable by the usual simplistic Math reasoning ..  ( ASSUMING this , that , etc )  
they follow rules absolutely deterministic,  
and you just need to accept that reallity is just always so ..
a cahotic progression over a fractal geometry ..  

fact is ..  
you built an imaginary world   
around a simple measuring TOOL   
( Math is just that )   
which is really great,  
as long you keep in mind it's just a TOOL ..  

problems being,  
when you start thinking, is Math that actually rules the world ..

which is at least bizarre,  
given that almost any Geometric Shape, Math is built around ..
DOESN'T REALLY EXIST !!

there's no such things as Triangles and Circles in nature ..

( yep I did say so , prove otherwise ! )

### PRIME NUMBERS ARE PREDICTABLE ..  

how ? .. well ..
