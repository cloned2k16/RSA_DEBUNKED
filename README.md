what if,,  
the ( usual ) ASSUMPTION on which is based the famous ''security'' algorithm you rely on ..  
IS ACTUALLY FLAWED at the very root Â¿?

![images tells more than thowsand words ..](logo.jpg)

### what's the point ?
Well,  
suppose I can predict exactly where and how any prime will show up ?  
In fact this wouldn't sound strange at all, question is ..  
why still anybody BELIEVE  that,
prime numbers, are apearing randomply sparse directly from the hand of some GOD ?  
they are just predictable as many others things, which despite having,  
a coahotic progression, that prevents them from being predictable by the usual simplistic Math reasoning ..  
( ASSUMING this , that , etc )  
they follow rules absolutely deterministic,  
and you just need to accept that reallity is just always so ..  
a cahotic progression over a fractal geometry ..  

fact is ..  
you built an imaginary world   
around a simple measuring TOOL   
( Math is just that )   
which is really great,  
as long you keep in mind it's just a TOOL ..  

problems being,  
when you start thinking, 
that Math actually rules the world ..

which is at least bizarre,  
given that almost any Geometric Shape, Math is built around ..
DOESN'T REALLY EXIST !!

there's no such things as Triangles and Circles in nature ..

( yep I did say so , prove otherwise ! )

### PRIME NUMBERS ARE PREDICTABLE ..  

how ? ..  
well ..  
this is a still secret right now, try to figure it out ..  
as soon as I can finish to write it down, will demonstrate it ..  

#### however, even more funny is that ..  
You can even get to any private key 'root numbers',  
without using prime numbers,   
AT ALL ..  

basically, once finished with this algorithm,   
you may be able to find 2 factors   
of any arbitrary digits length product,  
without factorization AT ALL.
